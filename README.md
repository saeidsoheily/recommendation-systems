Example codes and experiments around recommendation systems

Recommendation systems (or recommender systems) capture the pattern of user's behaviour and use it to predict what else they might want ot like, or more simply, to predict the rating or preference a user would give to an item.

The applications of recommender systems are: playlist generators for video and music services such as Netflix and Spotify, product recommenders for services such as Amazon, content recommenders for social media platforms such as Facebook, etc.
There are, basically, 2 types of recommender systems: collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
